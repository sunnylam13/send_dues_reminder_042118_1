High level

* read data from Excel sheet

* find all members who've not paid dues for last month

* find email addresses and send them personalized reminders

Code level

* open and read cells of Excel sheet with `openpyxl`

* create a dict of members who are behind

* log into SMTP with `smtplib.SMTP()`, `ehlo()`, `starttls()`, `login()`

* for those behind on dues send personalized email using `sendmail()`

	smtpObj.login( 'my_email', sys.argv[1] )

pass your email address and `sys.argv[1]`, which will store your password string. 

Youâ€™ll enter the password as a command line argument each time you run the program, to avoid saving your password in your source code.

	MacBook-Air:send_dues sunnyair$ python3 send_dues_reminder_042118_1.py PWDHIDDEN

every time I try to log in with the password I only get a prompt

if I remove the pwd it works however that's it

hit pwd statement

	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "send_dues_reminder_042118_1.py", line 63, in <module>

	  File "send_dues_reminder_042118_1.py", line 58, in <module>
	    logging.debug( 'pwd was:  %s' % str(sys.argv[1]) )

only works when hard coded

I realized the issue was that I forgot to pass `sys.argv[1]` through `str()` method to convert to string

Still won't work:

	smtpObj.login( 'avatar.sage7@gmail.com', str(sys.argv[1]) )

result

maybe try `optparse`
